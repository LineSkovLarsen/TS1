% Indsæt billede når det er færdigt

This study is divided in three fases the initial fase 1, knowledge/data collection fase 2 and analysis/outcome fase 3. 
In fase 1 the topic was selected and translated into questions and hereby the problem statement. In this process the delimitation of the project was laid out. Furthermore the methodology was chosen during this fase in the project. The methodology contains considerations in literature search, interview method and data analyzing methods. 
Fase 2 is the process to gain knowledge and collect the necessary data to analyze the problem. The knowledge is gathered through a literature search in the area. The method is described in \cref{literature}. The data is collected throughout interviews with both cardiac patients and a research nurse. To learn more about the interview and the empirical process read \cref{qualitative} and \cref{empirical}.
In fase 3 the collected data and knowledge is analyzed and evaluated. Furthermore the newly gathered information are discussed within the literature search. The closing statement in this study will be an overall conclusion of the studies findings. The last process in the project is to reflect and look into further investigation of the problem. 

\section{Literature search method}
\label{literature}

The literature was conducted with a thorough literature research. To find the right type of literature PICO(Population/Problem, Intervention, Comparison/Control, Outcome) was used as a framework, see \cref{PICO}. %Indsæt reference til tabel
Following databases have been used for this project: PubMed, AUlibrary, Embase, google scholar, % Er der flere?
The literature search started in february 2018 where the primary part of the literature was collected within two month, all though literature has been collected through the hole period of writing the project. 
Search keywords was conducted in the problem statement and have been used for search words in the databases. The papers were chosen from title and abstract. Furthermore other literature was conducted through a chained search in relevant literature. Multiple papers was deselected due to irrelevance or mismatch of the subject. The national guidelines and national history was conducted on state webpages. The keywords were combined with an "AND" - and in related areas as "OR". The PICO blocks was as well combined with the "And" and "OR". % skal vi have noget om hvilket år artiklen er skrevet som afgrænsning
