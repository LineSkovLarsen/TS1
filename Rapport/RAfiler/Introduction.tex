\subsection{The Danish Healthcare System}

structure reform 

The establishment of the danish healthcare system started in the eighteenth century. The first hospital was placed in Copenhagen and it opened in 1757. This hospital is still functioning and is today known as Rigshospitalet. Outside the capital small hospitals were build during the late eighteenth century in 1927 there was a total of 140 somatic hospitals in Denmark. 
\subsection{Target Group and Market Segment}


\section{Problemstatement}
The total cost of treating cardiovascular patients at the hospitals in Denmark was 5.5 billion DKK in 2015. The incidence is approximately 55.700 a year. About 107.100 Danes get admitted to the hospital every year due to a cardiovascular disease. Overall this will be 148.600 admission due to approximately 23 percent of the cardiovascular patients are readmitted into the hospital within 30 days after being discharged. Beyond the admissions the Danish system have 73.100 ambulant consultation within the hospital. Every year 12.400 Danish citizens dies from cardiovascular disease and it is thereby the second most common cause of death in Denmark . 

All this indicates that cardiovascular patients constitute a large part of the Danish states economy. This leads to our problem statement which is:

•	How can ICT be used to shorten hospital stay for cardiovascular patients?
•	Which barriers/challenges can such system meet in implementation?
•	What impact would an ICT solution for rehabilitation have on both cardiovascular patients and the Danish healthcare system?
